        <h3>What website did I choose?</h3>
        <p>I chose the website for the game <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main">Zenless Zone Zero</a> <br>
            which is a game that I've been playing recently.
        </p>
        <h3>How does it relate to the lesson?</h3>
        <p>The website utilizes css and JavaScript to create a very stylistic website for the viewer to enjoy. <br> 
            You can see animations all over the front page like on the download button<br>
         and even the sidebar which states which canvas of the page you are currently on.<br>
         The sidebar in particular is a feature that I wish to implement on my page in the future.<br>
         As shown in the picture,the sidebar is an image which moves up or down to show the number of the<br>
         canvas that you are currently in
