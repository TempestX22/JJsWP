<h2>Webpage Analysis</h2>
<div class="intro">
<p>The website I chose was <a href="https://taper.badquar.to/11/click_to_confirm.html">"Click to Confirm"</a>. Between the script tags, the developer created a constant named “r” which chooses a random item from the array named “a”. <br> 
    The array is filled with multiple words which form a sentence when put together. However, to guarantee that a coherent sentence <br> 
    would be created the developer divided the words into 4 sections; personal pronouns, first adjective, conjunctions, and second adjective. <br> 
    They enclosed each section in “[]” and separated them with commas (,).
    The following code “const dv = document.querySelector('div'); <br> 
    the second part of the code made it so that the first “div” element gets repeated 9 times. <br> 
    The first “div” element included the red marker on the left, the patterned image, and the paragraph ('p'p') which is where the created sentence goes. <br> 
    Moving on the following code “const ds = document.querySelectorAll('details'); <br> 
    const ps = document.querySelectorAll('p');” This selects all details and <p> elements, storing them in the ds and ps arrays, respectively. And lastly, <br> 
    is the code that takes care of activating the creation of a new phrase every time a “detail” or patterned image gets clicked while closing the previous <br> 
    “detail” that was opened and erases the phrase that was created.
