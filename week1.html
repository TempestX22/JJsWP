       <div class="content"> <h3>What's interesting to me in this work and why?</h3>
        <p>I chose the the <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main">css zen garden website </a> <br>
            I found it interesting because it demonstrated the capabilities of css and how much can be done with it <br>
            Without having to dive deep into JavaScript and the ways that it can edit the DOM.
        </p>
        <h3>Other media the page reminds me of, and how are they related?</h3>
        <p>Even though it utilizes css, it really reminds me of p5.js. <br> 
        The reason being because its essentially a simplified way of creative<br>
        which is easier to understand for someone who is starting out with web programming.<br>
        They both essentially lower the barrier of entry for the field which also encourages people to continue doing it.<br>
        Below I provided a picture of one of the websites that I like the design of.<br>
